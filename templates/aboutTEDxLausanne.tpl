	<p class="span12">
 	 The TEDxLausanne community seeks to extend the TED experience at a regional level, highlighting exceptional people and creative works, connecting people across disciplines, creating conversations that drive action. We explore big questions with a broad spirit of inquiry.
	</p>

	<p class="span12">
	The first TEDxLausanne event was held in September 2010 at IMD business school, Lausanne. Around 100 participants attended. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and encouraged us to organise another event. In January 2012, again in partnership with IMD, TEDxLausanne organized a full-scale event based on the theme “The future doesn’t just happen”. Once again, the event witnessed a huge success and was completely sold out (360 people attended it).

	<p class="span12">
	TEDxLausanne 2013 will feature over 12 inspiring speakers and performers and welcome 350 participants. The TEDxLausanne team consists entirely of volunteers who are dedicated to the TED concept of “ideas worth spreading”. To ensure the continuity of TEDxLausanne and develop a local community around this concept, an association named “Lausanne Bounces” was founded. (TED does not allow legal entities to include TED or TEDx in their name.)
	</p>
	<p class="span12">
	The TEDxLausanne 2013 team of organizers consists of 30 highly-motivated volunteers from very varied backgrounds. Their goal, beyond teaming up to organize an unforgettable event, is to offer a stage to people with innovative and engaging ideas and projects. Beyond the organisation of TEDxLausanne, the volunteers behind the event form a fresh and dynamic community, always evolving and in search for new ideas and projects to share.

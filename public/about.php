  In the spirit of “ideas worth spreading”, TED created a program called TEDx, consisting of local, independently organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Live speakers and a few pre-recorded TEDTalk videos are combined to spark deep discussion and connection in a relatively small group. TED provides general guidance for the TEDx program, including rules and regulations that local organizers must follow. Hundreds of TEDx events have already been organized around the world.

	The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
